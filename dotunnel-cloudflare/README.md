# DOtunnel service on Cloudflare

DOtunnel dashboard and relay implementation powered by Cloudflare Workers.

> ![NOTE]
> It is currently a monolith for the simple deployment, but later relay server implementation can be separated into a service binding (also [RIIR](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs)) later
